### Anomaly Detection in Air Quality in Turkey

## Description: 
The purpose of the application; To make air quality analysis at every point in Turkey. Our data set consists of time
series data based on 7 different variables collected through stations from 346 different points of Turkey. The data are
scraped from the official site of the Turkish Ministry of Climate with the SELENIUM library. It is analyzed with
different time frequencies using the PLOTLY library. Anomaly detection is made by using ISOLATION FOREST and
PROPHET libraries and it facilitates control with warning systems. Forecasting is done by using LSTM, ARIMA and
PROPHET algorithms and it enables to take precautions for problems that may occur in the future. STREAMLIT is
used to publish the application publicly and to continuously improve the models with CLOUD-BASED PROCESSING.
Thus, optimization is ensured in the inspection processes in the relevant institutions and a better quality breathing
air is obtained.
